My research centers around equatorial dynamics. As a kitesurfer and sailor, I am particularly interested in surface winds and processes within the atmospheric boundary layer over the oceans. The equator is one of the warmest areas on our planet on an annual average. At the same time, there are wind-driven currents in the ocean that transport cold water masses to the surface where they interact with the warm atmosphere. We get a region with strong temperature gradients, which is a perfect starting situation for pressure gradients and resulting winds. Exciting, isn't it ?
