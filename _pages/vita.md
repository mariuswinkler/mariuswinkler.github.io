I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Meteorologie in Hamburg, working at the intersection of atmosphereâ€“ocean interaction and boundary layer dynamics. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Earth System Sciences at the Max-Planck-Institut and UniversitÃ¤t Hamburg (2021â€“2025), where I focused on boundary layer wind balances and their influence on equatorial sea-surface temperatures. My work was supervised by Bjorn Stevens and Juan Pedro Mellado and centered on momentum analysis, surface winds, and tropical climate dynamics.

Before my Ph.D., I studied theoretical physics at the Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris and the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. My Masterâ€™s thesis explored phase response approaches to neural activity models with delay, combining nonlinear dynamics and neuroscience. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics from TU Berlin, where I investigated synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators. Earlier in my path, I completed a journeyman apprenticeship as a bespoke shoemaker

in northern Germany â€” an experience that shaped my appreciation for detail and craftsmanship.

In September 2024, I took part in the ORCESTRA field campaign at the Barbados Cloud Observatory as a field scientist, where I coordinated atmospheric observations and led the radiosonde launch team on Barbadis. Since 2021, I have also contributed to science communication as a member of the instituteâ€™s social media team, helping to share climate research with broader audiences.
