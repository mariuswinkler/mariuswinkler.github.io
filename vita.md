I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut für Meteorologie in Hamburg, working at the intersection of atmosphere–ocean interaction and boundary layer dynamics. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Earth System Sciences at the Max-Planck-Institut and Universität Hamburg (2021–2025), where I focused on boundary layer wind balances and their influence on equatorial sea-surface temperatures. My work was supervised by Bjorn Stevens and Juan Pedro Mellado and centered on momentum analysis, surface winds, and tropical climate dynamics.

Before my Ph.D., I studied theoretical physics at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and the Technische Universität Berlin. My Master’s thesis explored phase response approaches to neural activity models with delay, combining nonlinear dynamics and neuroscience. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from TU Berlin, where I investigated synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators. Earlier in my path, I completed a journeyman apprenticeship as a bespoke shoemaker in northern Germany—an experience that shaped my appreciation for detail and craftsmanship.

In September 2024, I took part in the ORCESTRA field campaign at the Barbados Cloud Observatory as a field scientist, where I coordinated atmospheric observations and led the radiosonde launch team on Barbadis. Since 2021, I have also contributed to science communication as a member of the institute’s social media team, helping to share climate research with broader audiences.
