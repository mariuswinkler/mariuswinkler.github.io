(*"Der rote Faden" is a German idiom which refers to a common theme or thread that runs through a story (or a CV). It translates to "the red thread" in English)

I arrived at the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg by a roundabout way.
Nature, our Earth, and the universe have always interested me. That's why I started studying physics, in order to understand what holds the world together at its core.
Physics is magnificent: armed with a toolbox of mathematics, physicists look out into the world and strive to comprehend and quantify what's happening out there.
That intrigued me. That's what I wanted to do.

In Berlin, as part of my bachelor's thesis, I delved into complex networks governed by nonlinear dynamics. These complex networks aren't always visible to the naked eye, but they exist everywhere. For instance, in the human brain. During my master's thesis in Paris, as a member of a neuroscientific research group, I examined signal propagation and synchronization of neurons in the brain. Extreme and sudden synchronization can manifest as epilepsy, which afflicts many people.
Not only an exciting, but also incredibly important subject.

After completing my master's thesis, I wanted to stay in science. That was clear.
But I wanted to understand processes observable with the naked eye. As a journeyman shoemaker, complex processes are aesthetically appealing to me. Earth's climate and our atmosphere represent colossal complex networks. Furthermore, Earth's climate is subject to numerous nonlinear dynamics, bringing us back to the beginning of my career.

I am excited about many more years in the field of climate research !

P.S. If you're curious to hear me speak, you can watch the video on the IMPRS website. For the shoot I had to ride several kilometers on my bike early in the morning, right after sunrise, on deserted streets in the Hamburger Speicherstadt. It was fun!
